📝 Project Overview
This project is a complete end-to-end Sentiment Analysis pipeline using Python. It takes in a CSV file of textual data (such as comments, tweets, or reviews), cleans and processes the text, performs sentiment classification using TextBlob, and produces insightful visualizations like sentiment distribution, word clouds, and sentiment trends over time.

It's ideal for analyzing customer feedback, social media conversations, survey responses, or any form of textual data where sentiment matters.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python 3.7+

Libraries:

pandas – data loading and manipulation

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization

wordcloud – for generating visual word clouds

TextBlob – simple sentiment analysis

re – text preprocessing (regex)

📦 Installation
Before running the notebook or script, install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas textblob matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
You may also need to download textblob corpora once:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m textblob.download_corpora
📂 Dataset Format
Your CSV file (sentimentdataset.csv) should include at least:

A column with text data (e.g. reviews, posts, tweets)

A timestamp column (optional but required for trend analysis)

Example:

Text	Timestamp
I love this product!	2024-12-01 10:45:00
This was a terrible experience	2024-12-02 14:12:00
Ensure the column names match those in the script or update the variable names accordingly.

🚀 How It Works
Step 1: Load Dataset
python
Copy
Edit
df = pd.read_csv("/content/sentimentdataset.csv")
Step 2: Clean Text
Removes links, mentions, hashtags, and special characters

Converts text to lowercase

python
Copy
Edit
def clean_text(text):
    ...
df['cleaned_text'] = df['Text'].apply(clean_text)
Step 3: Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob
Classifies sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral

Optional: also extract polarity score

python
Copy
Edit
def get_sentiment(text):
    ...
df['sentiment'] = df['cleaned_text'].apply(get_sentiment)
Step 4: Visualizations
Bar chart of sentiment distribution

Word cloud of common terms

Line graph of sentiment trends over time

python
Copy
Edit
sns.countplot(data=df, x='sentiment')
...
WordCloud().generate(all_words)
...
sentiment_trend.plot(kind='line')
📈 Output
processed_sentiment_data.csv – cleaned and labeled dataset

🧠 Future Improvements
Use advanced models (e.g. BERT, Vader, RoBERTa)

Build a web app using Streamlit

Integrate with Power BI or Tableau for dashboards

Support multi-language sentiment analysis

Add subjectivity analysis

🛠 Customization
Change TEXT_COL = 'Text' if your column name is different

Adjust date parsing column name ('Timestamp')

Add more preprocessing (lemmatization, stopwords)
