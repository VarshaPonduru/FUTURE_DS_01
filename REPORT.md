This project presents two data analysis pipelines built using Python:

Sentiment Analysis Pipeline: Processes textual data (such as tweets or reviews), classifies sentiments using NLP techniques, and visualizes patterns across time and content.

Road Accident Data Analysis: Examines historical road accident datasets to uncover trends in severity, location, and time.

The objective is to gain actionable insights from both structured (accident logs) and unstructured (text) data using data science tools.

📌 Part 1: Sentiment Analysis of Textual Data
🧠 Objective
To analyze public opinion or user sentiment from textual data such as social media posts or customer reviews.

📁 Dataset Description
Source: CSV file sentimentdataset.csv

Fields:

Text: User-generated content (e.g., feedback or tweets)

Timestamp: Date and time of the post

⚙️ Methodology
Data Loading: Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Text Cleaning:

Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters using re.

Lowercased all text for normalization.

Sentiment Classification:

Used TextBlob to compute polarity scores.

Categorized posts as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Trend Analysis:

Extracted sentiment trends over time based on the Timestamp.

Visualization:

Count plot of sentiment categories.

Word Cloud of most frequent words.

Line graph showing daily sentiment trends.

📊 Key Results
Sentiment Distribution:

Majority of posts were Neutral, followed by Positive, then Negative.

Frequent Words:

Word cloud displayed frequent use of terms like "good", "love", "bad", etc.

Time Trend:

Noticed spikes in sentiment on certain days, possibly tied to events.

📌 Part 2: Road Accident Data Analysis
🧠 Objective
To explore patterns in road accident records for safety insights, such as common locations, severity distribution, and temporal patterns.

📁 Dataset Description
Source: Excel file Road Accident Data.xlsx

Fields (among others):

Accident Date

Accident_Severity

Day_of_Week

Local_Authority_(District)

Junction_Detail

⚙️ Methodology
Data Loading:

Read Excel file using pandas.

Date-Time Processing:

Converted Accident Date to datetime format.

Extracted year, month, day, and weekday for analysis.

Missing Value Check:

Inspected all columns for null values.

Exploratory Analysis:

Severity distribution using value_counts.

Frequency of accidents by day of the week.

Top accident hotspots (by district and junction).

📊 Key Results
Accident Severity:

Majority of accidents were classified as slight, followed by serious and fatal.

Day-wise Trends:

Highest number of accidents occurred on Fridays.

Hotspot Locations:

Identified top 10 locations with the highest accident counts.

📈 Visual Highlights
Sentiment Analysis
📉 Sentiment Distribution:
Bar chart showing classification across categories.

☁️ Word Cloud:
Common keywords from user text.

📆 Trend Graph:
Line chart of sentiment over time.

Accident Data
📅 Accidents by Day:
Weekday-level analysis to determine high-risk days.

📍 Top Locations:
Heatmap-ready data for accident-prone areas.

✅ Conclusion
The project demonstrates how Python can be effectively used to extract insights from both structured and unstructured data:

Sentiment Analysis provided a high-level view of public mood and frequently used words, useful for marketing, customer service, or public relations.

Accident Data Analysis revealed clear patterns in accident distribution, which can help transportation departments improve safety regulations and infrastructure planning.
